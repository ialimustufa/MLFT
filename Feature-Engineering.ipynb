using machine learning in practice is *feature engineering*: that is, taking whatever information you have about your problem and turning it into numbers that you can use to build your feature matrix.\n","\n","In this section, we will cover a few common examples of feature engineering tasks: features for representing *categorical data*, features for representing *text*, and features for
